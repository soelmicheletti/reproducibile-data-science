# Reproducing COVID-19 analysis

Data visualization is an incredibly powerful tool that can affect health policy decisions. Ensuring they are easy to interpret, and more importantly, showcase accurate insights from data is paramount for scientific transparency and the health of individuals. For this assignment, we reproduced COVID-19 visualizations and tables published by the New York Times. Specifically, we reproduced the following for January 17th, 2021:

1. New cases as a function of time with a rolling average plot
2. Table of cases, hospitalizations and deaths
3. The county-level map for previous week ('Hot spots') - the second plot on the page (only the 'Hot Spots' plot)
4. Table of cases by state - the second table on the page (do not need to include per 100,000 or per capita columns)
